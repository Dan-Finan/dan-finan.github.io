                            I'm <strong>Dan Finan</strong>, a Microsoft Power Platform consultant based in Kent, UK, where I live with my amazing wife and two children. I’m not someone who takes life too seriously, and I’m always up for a laugh!

                        <p>The backstory...</p>
                        <p>I started my career working as a teaching assistant with SEN children, before moving into a full-time teaching role. After some soul searching, I had to put my hands up and admit that working within a Primary school wasn’t for me (the daily headaches were a bit of a red flag!) Fortunately, the IT technician at the school only visited one day a week, which meant that I had to try and fix things myself – and the rest of the staff were very grateful. After muddling through by fixing a few printers, I got myself a job as a junior IT Technician at a Secondary school.</p>
                        <p>I quickly discovered that working within IT was quite enjoyable, and I spent the next five years working my way through a couple of senior roles before becoming a Network Manager. During this time, I built a great relationship with my MSP (for IT Services) and was later offered a job as a Project Engineer with them.</p>
                        <p>After a couple of years of sitting on the M25 (the best motorway in the world, by the way), supporting clients across London and Surrey, I worked my way up to a Systems Specialist role (in Microsoft Azure) before being promoted to Service Manager. After a year in management, I really missed being hands-on with tech, so I decided to roll the dice once more and turned my attention to the Power Platform.</p>
                        <p>I was incredibly lucky to meet the team at Bespoke XYZ at a partner event, and soon discovered that the Power Platform was definitely something I wanted to pursue. When the time was right, I applied for a consultancy role at Bespoke XYZ and was absolutely delighted when I got the job.</p>
                        <p>Since then, I’ve been absolutely loving the tech and the people I work with, and now I’ve set myself a new challenge – to build a community presence and contribute to wider adoption and learning around the Power Platform. I’m currently making friends and working on content for the community, and I have to admit it’s incredibly rewarding. It has taken 14 years but I’m satisfied that I’ve finally found the perfect role.</p>
                        <p>Now it’s up to me to work hard, master the tech, and produce valuable content for the Power Platform community.</p>
                        <p>If you ever see me at an event, please do say hello!</p>
